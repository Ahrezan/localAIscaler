This is an application that runs a lightweight version of the models used in Waifu2x directly on your local machine, instead of relying on a web browser, and provides a simple, user-friendly interface to interact with them.

### The models used in the program

| Waifu2x Models | Style     |
| :-------- | :------- |
| `models-cunet` | Artwork/Scans |
| `models-upconv_7_anime_style_art_rgb` | Artwork |
| `models-upconv_7_photo` | Photo |

## Note

The reason I use this Waifu2x application is due to the occasional downtime of online sites, which prevents me from performing image upscaling.
